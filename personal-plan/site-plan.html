      <h3>Find connection</h3>
      <p>
        So, where we can find the alumni?
        Let’s open Church Education System (CES). 
        There are two ways to find alumni through CES:
        1. Search using the search engine
        2. Search by job
        -Search from search engine
        From the header, click on "Connect" and then select "Explore the Community."
        Use the search bar to find alumni. Important!  Pay attention to the green icons in the profile pictures: mortarboard icon → Alumni, Book icon → Current students, Person icon → Not alumni
        Once you select a profile, see if there is a lighting mark next to the mortarboard icon. This indicates that the person is more likely to respond to messages. Also, look for “Expertise” and find the person can help with. While you can massage to anyone, those who list expertise are more likely to provide assistance. 
        -Search from job
        From the header, click on "Career" and select "Jobs." Search for a job that interests you. Then, scroll down the job description and find someone who already worked there. If the people you selected is unavailable for that time, you won’t be able to massage them. If so, press profile and press “Get notified” to send a massage when they become available.

      </ul>
      <h3>Send massage</h3>
      <p>
        So, how can I send a massage to the alumni?
        There are two examples you can use as a reference. 
        1. Ask broadly
        2. Ask specifically
        -First example
        Hi [First Name of Alumni],
        My name is [Your First Name], and I am currently studying [Your Degree] at BYU-Idaho. I am exploring career possibilities in the field and would love the opportunity to ask you a few question about your experience and insights. I would greatly appreciate if you have 15-20 minutes to talk with me at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration.
        Sincerely,
        [Your Name]

        Key point
        ・Keep short and professional
        ・Make it clear who you are, your purpose, and your request
        ・Show respect and appreciation

        -Second example
        Hello [First Name of Alumni],
        My name is [Your Name], and I am a student at BYU-Idaho. I saw that you worked for [Company name] as [Position], and I would like to ask some questions about your career and experience. Will you be willing to speak with me for 15-20 minutes over this video chat? Thank you for your time considering. I look forward to hearing from you!
        Sincerely,
        [Your Name]

        Key point
        ・Do not ask for a Job
        ・Personalize the massage
        ・Show respect and appreciation

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        In header, there is a logo and a link to open CES. I Don't think I need a link connected with child page because I feel that is too much. It already exist in body.
        In footer, there would be a copy right. That is all.
      </p>
      <img src="images/home.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>         
        Header and footer are same as home page. I would add a link which connected with child 2.
      </p>
      <img src="images/child1.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        Header and footer are same as home page.
      </p>
      <img src="images/child2.png" alt="page 3 wireframe">
